# one-bit-music
Program to create one-bit music from text files. Does not support duty cycles other than 50% yet.

## Use
Run the python file `onebit.py` and then run
```python
compile_text('/path/to/inputfile.txt', '/path/to/outputfile.pcm')
```

## Specifications
Input is a text file, output is a raw mono unsigned 8-bit PCM file with a 44100 Hz sample rate. You can convert this into a WAV file using the FFmpeg command `ffmpeg -f u8 -ar 44100 -ac 1 -i input.file output.wav` or open it in Audacity by importing raw data and selecting "Unsigned 8-bit PCM" and "1 Channel (Mono)".

## Input format
The input consists of lines of four space-separated numbers. Each line is called an event. Newlines are ignored and lines can be commented out by using `#` or `//` at the start of the line.

The first number in an event dictates the type of sound. 0 means noise and 1 means a pulse wave.

The second number dictates the lowness of the noise (minimum 1 for highest noise) or the MIDI note number of the pulse wave.

The third number dictates if the event is audible (1) or silent (0).

The fourth number dictates the length of the event in samples.
